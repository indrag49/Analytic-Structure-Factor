# Abstract

We determine an analytic structure factor of charged particles using repulsive screened Coulomb pair potential. Here, we assume, counter ions and solvent as a uniform neutralising background which determines the screening of the potential. The model is useful for studying colloidal systems, especially for concentrated solution. We know that the intensity is proportional to the product of the form factor and the structure factor. The form factor along with the structure factor can be used to fit the intensity profile obtained for small angle x-ray scattering of macroions in the solution. Therefore, the present analysis will be useful in studying the behavior of the colloidal system.
